This file describes how to build and install thrust.

If you have Windows, see the file README.Win32 instead. Note, this file is
in the directory "DirectX" in the source distribution.

If you have the binary distribution, skip to 4.



1. What you need to build and install thrust

  * You will need a ANSI C compiler.
  * You will need a make that can handle text transforming functions, e.g the
    GNU Make utility.
  * You will also need one or more of X, SVGAlib 1.2 (or later) and SDL v1.2 to compile the source. The
    X version of the game will only run on 8 bpp pseudocolor visuals.
  * Root permissions so that SVGAlib can open the graphics display. No root
    access needed for the X version.

  Some files are prebuilt in the distribution, but if you would like to change
  anything in the source of these files you will need the following to rebuild
  these files

  * pod2man is used to build the man-page from the pod file. pod2man is a part
    of perl. Version 5.001 of perl is known to work.
  * The netpbm package so that the small utility based on it the can be
    compiled. The small utility is used to transform the graphics of the
    titlescreen to a C data structure which can be compiled into the program.

2. Configuring thrust

  A configure script is included, configure with:

      ./configure

  Note that the binary distribution is built with:

      ./configure --bindir=/usr/local/games --sharedstatedir=/var/games

  The configure script takes the following arguments:

  Configuration:
    --cache-file=FILE       cache test results in FILE
    --help                  prints a help message
    --no-create             do not create output files
    --quiet, --silent       do not print `checking...' messages
    --version               the version of autoconf that created configure
  Directory and file names:
    --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                            [/usr/local]
    --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
                            [same as prefix]
    --bindir=DIR            user executables in DIR [EPREFIX/bin]
    --sharedstatedir=DIR    modifiable architecture-independent data in DIR
                            [PREFIX/com]
    --mandir=DIR            man documentation in DIR [PREFIX/man]
  Features and packages:
    --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]    use PACKAGE [ARG=yes]
    --without-PACKAGE       do not use PACKAGE (same as --with-PACKAGE=no)
  --enable and --with options recognized:
    --enable-sound          try to include sound
    --with-x                use the X Window System
    --x-includes=DIR        X include files are in DIR
    --x-libraries=DIR       X library files are in DIR
    --with-svga             use SVGAlib
    --enable-svga-includes=DIR
                            SVGAlib include files are in DIR
    --enable-svga-libraries=DIR
                            SVGAlib library files are in DIR
    --with-pbm              use pbm, required to rebuild datasrc/title.c
    --enable-pbm-includes=DIR
                            pbm include files are in DIR
    --enable-pbm-libraries=DIR
                            pbm library files are in DIR

3. Building thrust

  * In the directory that this file is in, type `make'. This will build one or
    more of `thrust', `xthrust' and `sdlthrust', depending on how thrust was
    configured.
  * At the top of the file `src/thrust.h' the speed of the game and the
    relative weight of the blob can be changed. You can fiddle with these
    settings if you are not satisfied with the feel of the steering.

4. Installing thrust

  * Become root.
  * Then as root, type `make install'. This will copy one or more of the
    programs `thrust', `xthrust' and `sdlthrust' to `--bindir'. For the binary
    distribution, both programs are copied to /usr/local/games/. When `thrust'
    is installed, the setuid flag will be set as is required by all SVGAlib
    programs. You will want thrust, xthrust and sdlthrust to have write access
    to the highscore file. This can be solved in two ways (at least). The
    simplest way is to give everybody write access to the file (chmod ugo=rw).
    A slightly more refined way is to set the sgid flag on thrust, xthrust and
    sdlthrust (chmod g+s) and then make thrust, xthrust, sdlthrust and the
    highscore file belong to the same group (chgrp). When doing it this way,
    there is no need for the highscore file to be world writeable (chmod ug=rw).
    The second approach is the one taken by `make install'. The binary
    distribution installs the highscore file as `/var/games/thrust.highscore'.
    The highscore file will be created with the correct permissions if it does
    not exist. In case it does exist, it isn't touched, and you may have to set
    up its permissions by hand in order for it to work as intended.
  * Also type `make install-man' to install a man page in section 6 (games).
    For the binary distribution, this is installed in `/usr/local/man/man6/'.
  * If you have the binary distribution and are not happy about the default
    locations, these can easily be changed within the Makefile.

Security concerns

  * All programs that use SVGAlib must be started as root. Either root starts
    the program, or the program is suid root so that everybody can run it as if
    they were root. A normal SVGAlib application gives up its root priviliges
    right after the graphics have been initilized. Root priviliges are given up
    within the call to vga_init().
