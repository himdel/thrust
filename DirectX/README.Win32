This file describes how to build thrust on a Windows machine.

1. What you need to build thrust

  * Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0
  * Windows 95/98 or Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 or later.

  A project file is included for Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0, but I am certain
  that a similar file for other environment are straight forward to create.

2. How to build thrust

  * move the file DirectX/config.h to src/config.h
  * build the project.
